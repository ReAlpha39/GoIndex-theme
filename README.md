# GoIndex-theme-acrou 
Combining the power of [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) and [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) will allow you to index you files on the browser on Cloudflare Workers.    

[goindex/index.js](https://github.com/Aicirou/goindex-theme-acrou/go2index) is the content of the Workers script.  

This theme's goindex is currently based on [yanzai/goindex](https://github.com/yanzai/goindex/)

## How to Get Your Own client_id
1. Log into the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) with your Google account. It doesn‚Äôt matter what Google account you use. (It need not be the same account as the Google Drive you want to access)

2. Select a project or create a new project.

3. Under ‚ÄúENABLE APIS AND SERVICES‚Äù search for ‚ÄúDrive‚Äù, and enable the ‚ÄúGoogle Drive API‚Äù.

4. Click ‚ÄúCredentials‚Äù in the left-side panel (not ‚ÄúCreate credentials‚Äù, which opens the wizard), then ‚ÄúCreate credentials‚Äù, then ‚ÄúOAuth client ID‚Äù. It will prompt you to set the OAuth consent screen product name, if you haven‚Äôt set one already.

5. Choose an application type of ‚Äúother‚Äù, and click ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù. (the default name is fine)

6. It will show you a client ID and client secret. Use these values in rclone config to add a new remote or edit an existing remote.

## About

At the beginning of this project, it was just to satisfy my personal perception and experience development. When this project reaped the first start, the first fork and the first issues, and then everyone began to make suggestions, I had the power to update. Thank you very much for your support. Now we have version 2.0.
